# About Buildbotics

## Our Mission
Our main goal is to make desktop manufacturing easier.  CNC, 3D printers and
LASER cutters are awesome tools but using them can be both expensive and
challenging.  Fortunately, many companies are beginning to produce relative
inexpensive machines but the software and controllers that run them are either
very costly and difficult to use or poor quality and lacking features.  We
believe desktop manufacturing is for everyone.

## The Company
